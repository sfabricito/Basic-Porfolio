# Basic-Porfolio made with HTML and CSS
This is a simple project made with the basics technologies of web development.

## Some information

### Who made this project?
I am Fabricio Solis Alpizar, a Junior developer who is creating a portfolio to show his skills and this project is one of it.
You can follow me to see future projects in [GitHub](https://github.com/sfabricito) or on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sfabricito) account.

### Why I made this project?
I started programming 3 years ago and code web pages 2 years ago but I never created a portfolio of my projects. So I decided to start a personal portfolio to show my abilities.

### Do I created the design?
I know the design it's beautiful but I am not a designer ðŸ˜….
Some time ago I found the design in Instagram on the account of [BaBi & Co.](https://www.instagram.com/babi.n.co/), and I wondered why don't made in HTML and CSS.

### What I learned in the process?
Long time ago that I didn't make any webpage and it forced me to review a lot of terms and concepts that I had forgotten. Honestly I lasted a lot of time creating this landing page because my strong point it's coding with some programming languages.
